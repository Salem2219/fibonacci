# Program for Fibonacci numbers
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with seed values

   F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.

# FSMD
Basic Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) example to calculate the nth fibonacci number up to the 14.

## Install

These examples use [ModelSim&reg; and Quartus&reg; Prime from Intel FPGA](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite), [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), make sure they are installed locally on your computer before proceeding.

## Usage

1. Grab a copy of this repository to your computer's local folder (i.e. C:\projects):

    ```sh
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/Salem22/fibonacci.git
    ```
2. Use Visual Studio Code (VSC) to edit and view the design files:

    ```sh
    $ cd fibonacci
    $ code .
    ```
    Click on the toplevel.vhd file in the left pane to view its contents.
    
3. From the VSC View menu, choose Terminal, in the VCS Terminal, create a "work" library:

    ```sh
    $ vlib work
    ```
    
4. Compile all the design units:

    ```sh
    $ vcom *.vhd
    ```
    
5. Simulate your design. For example, if n = 9 then y = 34:

    ```sh
    $ vsim work.tb
    ```
